# How to run a 4 pool RAID array

- [LBR-943] As a user, I want to be able to access a sandbox page, in a nicely formatted box for discussion, in a manner that doesn’t involve a bunch of idiotic action buttons at the top of the screen
- [WIKI-127] As a user, I want to navigate by clicking on words, so that instead of being able to go back, I have to spend an hour unsummarising the page using my keyboard
- [WKWD-448] As a user, I want to add emojis to communicate my feelings better, so that any future analysis of the text can be improved by machines
- [WIK-867] As a user, I want the ‘Help’ link at the top of the page to be exactly 1px higher than the wiki logo, so that the logo is permanently squeezed out of view by this ‘help’ I don’t even know how to see or why it’s there
- [WIK-45] As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete my edits so that I can be influenced by corrupting external influences and come to question the meaning of ‘truth’ and ‘knowledge’
